This is a demo for the backend of the Momentum Dashboard that utilizes RShiny as the frontend. 
This should not be treated as a final product as a different front-end framework may be chosen. 
Along with this, it is very likely that the backend will be refactored to include BIDS formatting and integrate DataLad.
If attempting to use demo, please view the official documentation for setting up usage of the PyDrive python package.
